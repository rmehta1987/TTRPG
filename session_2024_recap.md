### What has happend so far

##### Targos
{color:purple,text-align:center}

The adventures started off in the town of Targos where they heard unbelieveable and confusing stories of how the all townspeople were trying to survive in the "eternal cold" if icewind dale.  Some towns seem to be sacrificinghumans to Auril while others are sacrificing as much food as possible.  On top of this chaos other beings have taken advantage to steal and even murder causing even more mayhem to the people of ten-towns.  
::
A retired bounty hunter **Hlin** seems to notice the ragtag crew of the player characters and asks them to help investigate some murders.  She realizes the sacrifices can be thought of murders but someone is going around killing additional people at the same time a sacrifice happens.

{{note
****IMPORTANT****
The player characters learn through their discussion in Targos that the towns that are sacrificing someone once a month upon the full moon are doing it via a randomized lottery.  Since they have also arrived in ten-towns they have now been automatically enrolled in the lottery but can avoid being picked by helping the people of ten-towns.

::
 Amidst their investigation a forlon husband pleads with the player characters to help find his husband who has gone to help other adventures.  To save his husband our adventures must face a treacherous challenge of a mountain climb gone wrong. With their bravery and skills, the adventurers rescue the husband, earning gratitude and admiration from the townsfolk. As they prepare to depart, the adventurers decide to journey next to the town of Bryn Shander trying to further their investigation of sacrifices or un-sacrifices ?

##### Bryn Shander

While in Bryn Shander, they encountered a dead body tied to a tree on their way in. Upon entering the town, they further learned about a lottery system where citizens are randomly selected for sacrifice to appease the Frostmaiden and hopefully end the endless winter.  The group investigated rumors of murders happening in addition to the sanctioned sacrifices and learned that there was no murder weapon to be found but the murders had all been cleanly stabbed.  They also learend that the murders coincided with a traveling caravan that sells weapons.

They met with a caravan of traders/bounty hunters led by a dwarf named Torg too see if they could find a weapon that matched the description. One of Torg's associates, a man named Sephek, drew suspicion from the party.
When Boonie (the cleric) used Detect Evil on Sephek, it was revealed he was undead. Sephek attacked the party with ice-based weapons. After a tough battle, the group managed to defeat Sephek, potentially solving the mystery of the unsanctioned murders.

{{note
Key points in Bryn Shander:
- The town has a lottery system for sacrifices to the Frostmaiden
- There are unsanctioned murders happening in addition to the sacrifices
- Sephek claimed that he was killing people who bribed their way out of the lottery system.
- Sephek also claims that he was doing Auril's will as he was resurrected after a freak boating accident.

##### Bryn Shander Continues
{color:purple,text-align:center}

After solving the murder mystery, the adventurers get a good rest at the Northlook Tavern.  The adventurers are now unlikely heros as two dwarfs ask their aid in retriving stolen iron ingots offering them 50 GP per person. Torug and Buh'Nee also go talk to the local cleric to find any more information on the endless winter.

After Torug and Buh'Nee come back from the shrine the adventures go to find the iron ignots.  They find themselves fighting goblins to retrieve the iron ignots.  They defeat the goblins and Talon Kirby is able to convince two polar bears to join the adventures (the polar bears are hungry after all...)

Notes from House of the Morninglord:
- Mishann (neutral good priest of Amaunator) runs the shrine and aspires to see the sun regain its rightful place in the sky over Icewind Dale.  Mishann tells Torug and Buh'Nee that if they can find more information of the endless winter she will offer them a **free** reserruction.  
- Copper Knobberknocker a acoylte of the shrien and engineer he tells them he’s worried about a friend named Macreadus, who is conducting research at an old cabin in the wilderness. 
{{purple,#book,text-align:center,background:#aa88aa55
Copper says that if the characters find themselves nearby, he would appreciate it if they looked in on Macreadus, who’s trying to build a device that could end the Frostmaiden’s eternal winter and return summer to Icewind Dale.
}}
}}

Torug and Buh'nee tell the other adventures about Macreadus and become are very intrigued by this and the only clue they have is to go to the town of easthaven in search of Macreadus.

##### Easthaven

The adventurers take a respite in the White Lady and find a seance being conducted by Rinaldo.  All the adventurers except **Lithiun** are able to join the seance to ask questions from the White Lady who  knows about the recent happenings around the ten-towns.  There questions must be intriguing enough otherwise she will disappear and shatter the windows and maybe their hearing.  The White Lady gives 2 of the 3 answers where the last one is to obvious and she leaves in anger.

- Gray-skinned dwarves have been stalking the streets of Easthaven, Caer-Dineval, and Caer-Konig while invisible. Their intentions aren’t good. They hide aboard the town ferry  and in the ruins of Dinev’s Rest.
- A magic cauldron is hidden in some frozen, lakeside caves. The cauldron is guarded by an evil hag named Maud Chiselbone and can conjure enough stew to feed a starving town indefinitely (see “Toil and Trouble”).

The adventureres get sidetracked from the current mission of finding Macreadus and try to solve the Duegar problem and go towards Easthaven ferry to inspect.

Upon investigating the Ferry they find a map and are attacked by Durth who has been trying to find chardalyn.  The characters capture Durth, he warns his captors that he’s the son of Xardorok Sunblight, who will soon claim Icewind Dale as his kingdom, and it would be unwise for them to earn the wrath of so powerful a figure. Durth doesn’t give up any other information, however his minions are much easier convinced and offer the following information:
{{note
- Xardorok has a fortress hidden in the mountains. (The route to this fortress is marked on Durth’s map aboard the ferry.)
- Xardorok’s fortress has a forge powered by the still-beating heart of a red dragon. In this forge, Xardorok is crafting a dragon made of chardalyn, with which he plans to destroy Ten-Towns. The chardalyn dragon is close to being finished.
- Xardorok has another son, Nildar, who commands a secret outpost on the northeast side of Kelvin’s Cair.
}}

#### Caer-Konig

The adventureres arrive in Caer-Konig and are immediately bombarded with quests by a drunkard (but not really drunk) dragonborn Torvus who tells of them of a cabin near Kelvin's Cair.   Trovus leads the characters through Caer-Konig to the Northern Light on the eastern edge of town to two sisters Allie and Cori who tell them about the robberies and break-ins happening.

{{note
These robberies are nearly identical to the ones in Easthaven.
}}

The only clue is a set of tracks leading in the direction of Kelvin’s Cairn. Allie thinks the tracks were made by dwarves who live in the valley at the base of Kelvin’s Cairn.  The adventurers realize this must be the hidden outpost they found out about while in Easthaven.  Since it is on the way to the abandoned cabin they might as well check this area out.

The adventurers try to sneak in, but due to the nature of the outpost they are seen and beging to battle the duegars.    Luckily the alarm has not been sounded off so the adventurers are currently in a room with a very heavy metal door that does not seem to budge.
